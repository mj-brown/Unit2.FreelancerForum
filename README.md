## Block 19 Workshop: Freelancer Forum

In this repo I created a platform wree independent freelancers cn advertise their services.

# Technologies

For this I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Usage

This platform initially generates 2 freelancers when launched.  Then every 3 seconds it randomly generates a new freelancer and adds it to the list.  As the new freelancers are added, it also shows the average starting price for the freelancers.  The average price changes as a new freelancer is added to the list.
